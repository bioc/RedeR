Description: RedeR is an R-based package combined with a stand-alone Java application for dynamic network visualization and manipulation. It implements a callback engine by using a low-level R-to-Java interface to build and run common plugins. In this sense, RedeR takes advantage of R to run robust statistics, while the R-to-Java interface bridges the gap between network analysis and visualization: for R Developers, it allows the development of Java plug-ins exclusively using R codes; for Java Users, it runs R methods implemented in a stand-alone application, and for R Users RedeR interactively displays R graphs using a robust Java graphic engine embedded in this package.
