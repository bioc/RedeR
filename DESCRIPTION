Description: RedeR is an R-based package combined with a stand-alone Java application for interactive visualization and manipulation of nested networks and hierarchical structures. It implements a callback engine by using a low-level R-to-Java interface to build and run common plugins. In this sense, RedeR takes advantage of R to run robust statistics, while the R-to-Java interface bridges the gap between network analysis and visualization.
